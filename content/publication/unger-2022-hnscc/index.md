abstract: "HPV-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) generally has favorable prognosis, but a subset of patients experience treatment failure. Using genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of 120 HPV-positive HNSCC samples, we identified distinct epigenetic subtypes with different clinical outcomes. Integration with gene expression data revealed subtype-specific pathway activation. Our findings suggest that epigenetic profiling can refine prognostic stratification in HPV-positive HNSCC and may guide treatment intensification or de-escalation strategies."

summary: "Epigenetic subtyping of HPV-positive head and neck cancer for improved prognostic stratification."

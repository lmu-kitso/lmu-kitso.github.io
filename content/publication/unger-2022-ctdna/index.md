abstract: "Purpose: Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) may serve as an early biomarker for treatment response. We investigated ctDNA dynamics during radiotherapy in patients with solid tumors. Experimental Design: Serial plasma samples were collected from 62 patients with various solid tumors before, during, and after radiotherapy. ctDNA was quantified using tumor-informed personalized assays. Results: Early ctDNA clearance during radiotherapy was associated with favorable outcomes. Patients with persistent ctDNA at mid-treatment had significantly shorter progression-free survival. Conclusions: ctDNA monitoring during radiotherapy enables early response assessment and may guide adaptive treatment strategies."
